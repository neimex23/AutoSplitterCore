Notes:
===========================================
AutoSplitting:
- If You have problems to setup Extencion visit: https://github.com/neimex23/HitCounterManager/wiki

- To activate any autosplitting you should select in main program "Game to Split".

- To Auto initialize Timer should select in main program "Game to Split" and check the game in Configuration AutoSplitter AutoTimer

- Is recommended to configure everything before setting the game to spliter, to avoid autosplitting

-Depends on Configurable Autosplit, the addons autosplitting a split (+1 in the actually position), 
regardless of what is written on them

- When an event of autosplit happens, an internal variable is set, for evit that event is repit. 
Use the "Reset Run" button, Shortcut or AutoReset Option, to reset this state.

- AutoTimer with RealTime Method in Celeste only start timer when join into a level, don't stop after this.

- Dark souls 2 don't have tracking game time to get exact values to give AutoSplitterCore and process it, failing that, the timer is controlled manually when there is a load event

- Currently Elden Ring is only supported with Easy Anti-Cheat disabled.
